ruby-riot
=========

ruby-riot is a ruby wrapper for the Riot Games Developer API. It also features a storage layer that stores values that aren't likely to change (champion names, etc.) to save on API requests while still allowing you to make the same calls in your own code. ruby-riot aims to be simple, easy to integrate, and very easy to use in your own projects!
